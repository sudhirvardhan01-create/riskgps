This analytic looks for the suspicious activity of a batch file being created within the C:\\Windows\\System32 directory tree. There will be only occasional false positives due to administrator actions.\n \n For Windows, Sysmon Event ID 11 (File create) can be used to track file creation events. This event also provides the Process ID of the process that created the file, which can be correlated with process creation events (e.g., Sysmon Event ID 1) to determine if the file was downloaded from an external network.\n \n For MacOS, utilities that work in concert with Apple’s Endpoint Security Framework such as File Monitor can be used to track file creation events.\n \n Analytic 1 - Batch File Write to System32\n \n <code> (source=\"*WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"11\") file_path=\"*system32*\" AND file_extension=\".bat\"</code>",

    "mitreControlDescription": "Monitor network traffic for WMI connections for potential use to remotely edit configuration, start services, or query files. When remote WMI requests are over RPC it connects to a DCOM interface within the RPC group <code>netsvcs</code>. To detect this activity, a sensor is needed at the network level that can decode RPC traffic or on the host where the communication can be detected more natively, such as Event Tracing for Windows. Using wireshark/tshark decoders, the WMI interfaces can be extracted so that WMI activity over RPC can be detected. Although the description details how to detect remote WMI precisely, a decent estimate has been to look for the string RPCSS within the initial RPC connection on 135/tcp. It returns a superset of this activity, and will trigger on all DCOM-related services running within RPC, which is likely to also be activity that should be detected between hosts. More about RPCSS at : rpcss_dcom_interfaces.html\n \n Look for instances of the WMI querying in network traffic, and find the cases where a process is launched immediately after a connection is seen. This essentially merges the request to start a remote process via WMI with the process execution. If other processes are spawned from wmiprvse.exe in this time frame, it is possible for race conditions to occur, and the wrong process may be merged. If this is the case, it may be useful to look deeper into the network traffic to see if the desired command can be extracted.\n \n After the WMI connection has been initialized, a process can be remotely launched using the command: <code>wmic /node:\"<hostname>\" process call create \"<command line>\"</code>, which is detected in the third Detection Pseudocode. \n \n This leaves artifacts at both a network (RPC) and process (command line) level. When <code>wmic.exe</code> (or the schtasks API) is used to remotely create processes, Windows uses RPC (135/tcp) to communicate with the the remote machine.\n \n After RPC authenticates, the RPC endpoint mapper opens a high port connection, through which the schtasks Remote Procedure Call is actually implemented. With the right packet decoders, or by looking for certain byte streams in raw data, these functions can be identified.\n \n When the command line is executed, it has the parent process of <code>C:\\windows\\system32\\wbem\\WmiPrvSE.exe</code>. This analytic looks for these two events happening in sequence, so that the network connection and target process are output.\n \n Certain strings can be identifiers of the WMI by looking up the interface UUID for <code>IRemUnknown2</code> in different formats\n - UUID <code>00000143-0000-0000-c000-000000000046</code> (decoded)\n - Hex <code>43 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 c0 00 00 00 00 00 00 46</code> (raw)\n - ASCII <code>CF</code> (printable text only)\n \n This identifier is present three times during the RPC request phase. Any sensor that has access to the byte code as raw, decoded, or ASCII could implement this analytic. The transfer syntax is\n - UUID <code>8a885d04-1ceb-11c9-9fe8-08002b104860</code> (decoded)\n - Hex <code>04 5d 88 8a eb 1c c9 11 9f e8 08 00 2b 10 48 60</code> (raw)\n - ASCII <code>`]+H``</code> (printable text only)\n \n Thus, a great ASCII based signature is\n - <code>*CF*]+H*CF*CF*host*\"</code>\n \n Note: To detect WMI over RPC (using DCOM), a sensor needs to exist that has the insight into individual connections and can actually decode and make sense of RPC traffic. Specifically, WMI can be detected by looking at RPC traffic where the target interface matches that of WMI, which is IRemUnknown2. Look for instances of the WMI querying in network traffic, and find the cases where a process is launched immediately after a connection is seen. This essentially merges the request to start a remote process via WMI with the process execution. If other processes are spawned from wmiprvse.exe in this time frame, it is possible for race conditions to occur, and the wrong process may be merged. If this is the case, it may be useful to look deeper into the network traffic to see if the desired command can be extracted.\n \n Analytic 1 - Remote WMI over RPC\n \n <code>source=\"*Zeek:RPC\" dest_port=\"135\" protocol_rpc_interface=\"IRemUnknown2\"</code>",

It is possible to also connect via IP address, in which case the string <code>\"\\<hostname\\>\"</code> would instead look like IP Address.

Analytic 1 is oriented around looking for the creation of Microsoft Background Intelligent Transfer Service utility (bitsadmin.exe) processes that schedule a BITS job to persist on an endpoint. The analytic identifies the command-line parameters used to create, resume or add a file to a BITS job; these are typically seen combined in a single command-line or executed in sequence.\n \n Analytic 2 identifies Microsoft Background Intelligent Transfer Service utility <code> bitsadmin.exe </code> using the <code> transfer</code> parameter to download a remote object. In addition, look for <code> download </code> or <code> upload </code> on the command-line, the switches are not required to perform a transfer. Capture any files downloaded. Review the reputation of the IP or domain used. Typically once executed, a follow on command will be used to execute the dropped file. Network connection or file modification events related will not spawn or create from <code> bitsadmin.exe </code>, but the artifacts will appear in a parallel process of <code> svchost.exe </code> with a command-line similar to <code> svchost.exe -k netsvcs -s BITS </code>. It’s important to review all parallel and child processes to capture any behaviors and artifacts. In some suspicious and malicious instances, BITS jobs will be created.

The portion of the Web shell that is on the server may be small and innocuous looking. The PHP version of the China Chopper Web shell, for example, is very similar to the following short payload: (Citation: Lee 2013)\n \n `<?php @evaI($_P0ST['password']);>`\n \n Nevertheless, detection mechanisms exist. Process monitoring may be used to detect Web servers that perform suspicious actions such as spawning cmd.exe or accessing files that are not in the Web directory.(Citation: NSA Cyber Mitigating Web Shells)\n \n A web shell is a web script placed on an openly accessible web server to allow an adversary to use the server as a gatway in a network. As the shell operates, commands will be issued from within the web application into the broader server operating system. This analytic looks for host enumeration executables initiated by any web service that would not normally be executed within that environment.\n \n Analytic 1 - Webshell-Indicative Process Tree\n \n <code>(source=\"*WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"1\") OR (source=\"*WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode=\"4688\") (ParentImage=\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\*w3wp.exe\" OR ParentImage=\"*httpd.exe\" OR ParentImage=\"*tomcat*.exe\" OR ParentImage=\"*nginx.exe\")\n (Image=\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\cmd.exe OR Image=\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\SysWOW64\\\\cmd.exe\" OR Image=\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\*\\\\powershell.exe OR Image=\"C:\\\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\\\*\\powershell.exe OR Image=\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\net.exe\" OR Image=\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\hostname.exe\" OR Image=\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\whoami.exe\" OR Image=\"*systeminfo.exe OR Image=\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\ipconfig.exe\")</code>",

Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as network connections made for Command and Control, learning details about the environment through Discovery, and Lateral Movement.\n \n Windows runs the Service Control Manager (SCM) within the process services.exe. Windows launches services as independent processes or DLL loads within a svchost.exe group. To be a legitimate service, a process (or DLL) must have the appropriate service entry point SvcMain. If an application does not have the entry point, then it will timeout (default is 30 seconds) and the process will be killed.\n \n To survive the timeout, adversaries and red teams can create services that direct to cmd.exe with the flag /c, followed by the desired command. The /c flag causes the command shell to run a command and immediately exit. As a result, the desired program will remain running and it will report an error starting the service. This analytic will catch that command prompt instance that is used to launch the actual malicious executable. Additionally, the children and descendants of services.exe will run as a SYSTEM user by default. \n \n Note: Create a baseline of services seen over the last 30 days and a list of services seen today. Remove services in the baseline from services seen today, leaving a list of new services. Returns all processes named cmd.exe that have services.exe as a parent process.

    "mitreControlDescription": "Monitor newly executed processes that may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by accessibility features.\n \n An adversary can use accessibility features (Ease of Access), such as StickyKeys or Utilman, to launch a command shell from the logon screen and gain SYSTEM access. Since an adversary does not have physical access to the machine, this technique must be run within Remote Desktop. To prevent an adversary from getting to the login screen without first authenticating, Network-Level Authentication (NLA) must be enabled. If a debugger is set up for one of the accessibility features, then it will intercept the process launch of the feature and instead execute a new command line. This analytic looks for instances of cmd.exe or powershell.exe launched directly from the logon process, winlogon.exe. \n \n Several accessibility programs can be run using the Ease of Access center\n \n - sethc.exe handles StickyKeys\n - utilman.exe is the Ease of Access menu\n - osk.exe runs the On-Screen Keyboard\n - narrator.exe reads screen text over audio\n - magnify.exe magnifies the view of the screen near the cursor\n \n One simple way to implement this technique is to note that in a default Windows configuration there are no spaces in the path to the system32 folder. If the accessibility programs are ever run with a Debugger set, then Windows will launch the Debugger process and append the command line to the accessibility program. As a result, a space is inserted in the command line before the path. Looking for any instances of a space in the command line before the name of an accessibility program will help identify when Debuggers are set.\n \n The Windows Registry location HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options allows for parameters to be set for applications during execution. One feature used by malicious actors is the “Debugger” option. When a key has this value enabled, a Debugging command line can be specified. Windows will launch the Debugging command line, and pass the original command line in as an argument. Adversaries can set a Debugger for Accessibility Applications. The analytic looks for the original command line as an argument to the Debugger. When the strings “sethc.exe”, “utilman.exe”, “osk.exe”, “narrator.exe”, and “Magnify.exe” are detected in the arguments, but not as the main executable, it is very likely that a Debugger is set.\n \n Note: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 1 - process create) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). The Analytic example looks for any creation of common accessibility processes such as sethc.exe but does no other filtering, which may result in false positives. Therefore, we recommend tuning any such analytics by including additional logic (e.g., testing the name of the parent process) that helps reduce false positives.\n \n Analytic 2 could depend on the possibility of the known strings used as arguments for other applications used in the day-to-day environment. Although the chance of the string “sethc.exe” being used as an argument for another application is unlikely, it still is a possibility.\n \n Analytic 1 - Command Launched from Winlogon\n \n <code> (source=\"*WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"1\") OR (source=\"*WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode=\"4688\") AND ParentImage=\"winlogon.exe\" AND Image=\"cmd.exe\"AND \n (CommandLine=\"*sethc.exe\"\n OR CommandLine=\"*utilman.exe\"\n OR CommandLine=\"*osk.exe\" \n OR CommandLine=\"*narrator.exe\" \n OR CommandLine=\"*magnify.exe\"</code>\n \n Analytic 2 - Debuggers for Accessibility Applications\n \n <code> (source=\"*WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"1\") OR (source=\"*WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode=\"4688\") | where CommandLine match \"$.* .*(sethcutilmanosknarratormagnify)\\.exe\"</code>",

Many legitimate modifications are done graphically via regedit.exe or by using the corresponding channels, or even calling the Registry APIs directly. The built-in utility reg.exe provides a command-line interface to the registry, so that queries and modifications can be performed from a shell, such as cmd.exe. When a user is responsible for these actions, the parent of cmd.exe will likely be explorer.exe. Occasionally, power users and administrators write scripts that do this behavior as well, but likely from a different process tree. These background scripts must be learned so they can be tuned out accordingly.\n \n Output Description\n The sequence of processes that resulted in reg.exe being started from a shell.

    "mitreControlDescription": "Monitor the addition of the MiniNT registry key in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control, which may disable Event Viewer.(Citation: def_ev_win_event_logging)\n \n Adversaries may disable Windows event logging to limit data that can be leveraged for detections and audits. There are different ways to perform this attack.\n 1. The first one is to create the Registry Key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\MiniNt. This action will not generate Security EventLog 4657 or Sysmon EventLog 13 because the value of the key remains empty. However, if an attacker uses powershell to perform this attack (and not cmd), a Security EventLog 4663 will be generated (but 4663 generates a lot of noise).\n 2. The second way is to disable the service EventLog (display name Windows Event Log). After disabed, attacker must reboot the system. The action of disabling or put in manual the service will modify the Registry Key value HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventLog\\start, therefore Security EventLog 4657 or Sysmon EventLog 13 will be generated on the system.\n 3. The third way is linked with the second. By default, the EventLog service cannot be stopped. If an attacker tries to stop the service, this one will restart immediately. Why ? Because to stop completely, this service must stop others, one in particular called netprofm (display name Network List Service). This service remains running until it is disabled. So Attacker must either disable EventLog and after to stop it or disable netprofm and after stop EventLog. Only stopping the service (even as admin) will not have an effect on the EventLog service because of the link with netprofm. Security EventLog 1100 will log the stop of the EventLog service (but also generates a lot of noise because it will generate a log everytime the system shutdown).\n 4. The fourth way is to use auditpol.exe to modify the audit configuration and disable/modify important parameters that will lead to disable the creation of EventLog.\n 5. The last one is to modify the Registry Key value HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventLog\\Security\\file (or other kind of log) to modify the path where the EventLog are stocked. Importantly, with this technique, the EventViewer will use the value of the Registry Key “file” to know where to find the Log. Thus, using the EventViewer will always show the current event logs, but the old one will be stocked in another evtx. Also, the path must be in a folder that the Eventlog process has access (like it doesn’t work if attacker set up the new path in the Desktop). Attacker can also decrease the maxsize value of the Log to force the system to rewrite on the older EventLog (but the minimum cannot be less than 1028 KB). As the Registry key is modified, Security EventLog 4657 or Sysmon EventLog 13 will be generated on the system. All of these attacks required administrative right. Attacks number three, four and five do not require a system reboot to be effective immediately.\n \n Analytic 1 - Disable Windows Event Logging\n \n <code>(source=\"*WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode IN (4657, 4719) OR source=\"*WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"13\") \n (ObjectName=\"*EventLog*\") \n (ObjectValueName=\"Start\" OR ObjectValueName=\"File\" OR ObjectValueName=\"MaxSize\")</code>",

The first step to attempt the [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008) often involves conducting host identification, port and service scans on the internal network via the compromised machine using tools such as Nmap, Cobalt Strike, etc.\n \n Note: It should be noted that when a host/ port/ service scan is performed from a compromised machine, a single machine makes multiple calls to other hosts in the network to identify live hosts and services. This can be detected using the following query\n \n Analytic 1 - Identifying Port Scanning Activity\n \n <code>sourcetype='firewall_logs' dest_ip='internal_subnet' | stats dc(dest_port) as pcount by src_ip | where pcount >5</code>",

The Analytic looks for command-line instances of searching the Windows Registry for insecurely stored credentials. This can be accomplished using the query functionality of the [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075) system utility, by looking for keys and values that contain strings such as “password”. In addition, adversaries may use toolkits such as [PowerSploit](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0194) in order to dump credentials from various applications such as IIS. Accordingly, this analytic looks for invocations of reg.exe in this capacity as well as that of several PowerSploit modules with similar functionality.\n \n Analytic 1 - Credentials in Files & Registry\n \n <code>(source=\"WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"1\") OR (source=\"WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode=\"4688\") \n CommandLine=\"*reg* query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s*\" OR\n CommandLine=\"reg* query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s\" OR\n CommandLine=\"*Get-UnattendedInstallFile*\" OR\n CommandLine=\"*Get-Webconfig\" OR\n CommandLine=\"*Get-ApplicationHost*\" OR\n CommandLine=\"*Get-SiteListPassword*\" OR\n CommandLine=\"*Get-CachedGPPPassword*\" OR\n CommandLine=\"*Get-RegistryAutoLogon*\" </code>",

    "mitreControlDescription": "Detecting dynamically generated domains can be challenging due to the number of different DGA algorithms, constantly evolving malware families, and the increasing complexity of the algorithms. There is a myriad of approaches for detecting a pseudo-randomly generated domain name, including using frequency analysis, Markov chains, entropy, proportion of dictionary words, ratio of vowels to other characters, and more. (Citation: Data Driven Security DGA) CDN domains may trigger these detections due to the format of their domain names. In addition to detecting a DGA domain based on the name, another more general approach for detecting a suspicious domain is to check for recently registered names or for rarely visited domains.\n Machine learning approaches to detecting DGA domains have been developed and have seen success in applications. One approach is to use N-Gram methods to determine a randomness score for strings used in the domain name. If the randomness score is high, and the domains are not whitelisted (CDN, etc), then it may be determined if a domain is related to a legitimate host or DGA. (Citation: Pace University Detecting DGA May 2017) Another approach is to use deep learning to classify domains as DGA-generated(Citation: Elastic Predicting DGA)]",

In some cases, the seed that a particular sample uses can be extracted from DNS traffic.(Citation: Akamai DGA Mitigation) Even so, there can be thousands of possible domains generated per day; this makes it impractical for defenders to preemptively register all possible C2 domains due to the cost.",

For example, Windows Security Log events (Event ID 4670) are created when DACLs are modified.\n \n Adversaries sometimes modify object access rights at the operating system level. There are varying motivations behind this action - they may not want some files/objects to be changed on systems for persistence reasons and therefore provide admin only rights; also, they may want files to be accessible with lower levels of permissions.\n \n Windows environment logs can be noisy, so we take the following into consideration:\n \n - We need to exclude events generated by the local system (subject security ID “NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM”) and focus on actual user events.\n - When a permission modification is made for a folder, a new event log is generated for each subfolder and file under that folder. It is advised to group logs based on handle ID or user ID.\n - The Windows security log (event ID 4670) also includes information about the process that modifies the file permissions. It is advised to focus on uncommon process names, and it is also uncommon for real-users to perform this task without a GUI.\n - Pseudocode Event ID is for Windows Security Log (Event ID 4670 - Permissions on an object were changed). \n - Windows Event ID 4719 (An Attempt Was Made to Access An Object) can also be used to alert on changes to Active Directory audit policy for a system.\n \n Analytic 1 - Access Permission Modification for Windows\n \n <code> (source=\"*WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode IN (4670, 4719)) Object_Type=\"File\" Security_ID!=\"NT AUTHORITY\\\\SYSTEM\" </code>",

Although there may be more native ways to detect detailed SMB events on the host, they can be extracted out of network traffic. With the right protocol decoders, port 445 traffic can be filtered and even the file path (relative to the share) can be retrieved.\n \n Looking at this activity more closely to obtain an adequate sense of situational awareness may make it possible to detect adversaries moving between hosts in a way that deviates from normal activity. Because SMB traffic is heavy in many environments, this analytic may be difficult to turn into something that can be used to quickly detect an APT. In some cases, it may make more sense to run this analytic in a forensic fashion.

It is also possible for the user to not be aware of the addition of such an auto-forwarding rule and not suspect that their account has been compromised; email-forwarding rules alone will not affect the normal usage patterns or operations of the email account. Auto-forwarded messages generally contain specific detectable artifacts that may be present in the header; such artifacts would be platform-specific. Examples include <code>X-MS-Exchange-Organization-AutoForwarded</code> set to true, <code>X-MailFwdBy</code> and <code>X-Forwarded-To</code>. The <code>forwardingSMTPAddress</code> parameter used in a forwarding process that is managed by administrators and not by user actions. All messages for the mailbox are forwarded to the specified SMTP address. However, unlike typical client-side rules, the message does not appear as forwarded in the mailbox; it appears as if it were sent directly to the specified destination mailbox.(Citation: Microsoft Tim McMichael Exchange Mail Forwarding 2) High volumes of emails that bear the <code>X-MS-Exchange-Organization-AutoForwarded</code> header (indicating auto-forwarding) without a corresponding number of emails that match the appearance of a forwarded message may indicate that further investigation is needed at the administrator level rather than user-level.",

    "mitreControlDescription": "Detection is challenging because all messages forwarded because of an auto-forwarding rule have the same presentation as a manually forwarded message. It is also possible for the user to not be aware of the addition of such an auto-forwarding rule and not suspect that their account has been compromised; email-forwarding rules alone will not affect the normal usage patterns or operations of the email account. This is especially true in cases with hidden auto-forwarding rules. This makes it only possible to reliably detect the existence of a hidden auto-forwarding rule by examining message tracking logs or by using a MAPI editor to notice the modified rule property values.(Citation: Pfammatter - Hidden Inbox Rules)\n Auto-forwarded messages generally contain specific detectable artifacts that may be present in the header; such artifacts would be platform-specific. Examples include X-MS-Exchange-Organization-AutoForwarded set to true, X-MailFwdBy and X-Forwarded-To. The forwardingSMTPAddress parameter used in a forwarding process that is managed by administrators and not by user actions. All messages for the mailbox are forwarded to the specified SMTP address. However, unlike typical client-side rules, the message does not appear as forwarded in the mailbox; it appears as if it were sent directly to the specified destination mailbox.(Citation: Microsoft Tim McMichael Exchange Mail Forwarding 2) High volumes of emails that bear the X-MS-Exchange-Organization-AutoForwarded header (indicating auto-forwarding) without a corresponding number of emails that match the appearance of a forwarded message may indicate that further investigation is needed at the administrator level rather than user-level.\n \n In environments using Exchange, monitor logs for the creation or modification of mail transport rules.",

SID Filtering of external trusts is automatically enabled on all created external trusts using Server 2003 or later domain controllers.

Most of these tools utilize multiple techniques to try and attain SYSTEM: in the first technique, they create a named pipe and connects an instance of cmd.exe to it, which allows them to impersonate the security context of cmd.exe, which is SYSTEM. In the second technique, a malicious DLL is injected into a process that is running as SYSTEM; the injected DLL steals the SYSTEM token and applies it where necessary to escalate privileges.

First, a file is remotely written to a host via an SMB share; then, a variety of Execution techniques can be used to remotely establish execution of the file or script. To detect this behavior, look for files that are written to a host over SMB and then later run directly as a process or in the command line arguments.

Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Network Analysis frameworks such as Zeek can be used to capture, decode, and alert on RPC network flows.\n \n When a Windows Remote Management connection is opened, the client sends HTTP requests to port 5985 for HTTP or 5986 for HTTPS on the target host. Each HTTP(S) request to the URI “/wsman” is called, and other information is set in the headers. Depending on the operation, the HTTP method may vary (i.e., GET, POST, etc.). This analytic would detect Remote PowerShell, as well as other communications that rely on WinRM. Additionally, it outputs the executable on the client host, the connection information, and the hostname of the target host. Look for network connections to port 5985 and 5986. To really decipher what is going on, these outputs should be fed into something that can do packet analysis.\n \n Note: Traffic to the RPC Endpoint Mapper will always have the destination port of 135. Assuming success, RPC traffic will continue to the endpoint. The endpoint and the client both bind to dynamically assigned ports (on Windows, this is typically greater than 49152). The traffic between the client and endpoint can be detected by looking at traffic to 135 followed by traffic where the source and destination ports are at least 49152.",

On the remote host, the job files are created by the Task Scheduler and follow the convention <code>C:\\Windows\\System32\\AT<job\\_id></code>.\n \n This pipe activity could be discovered with a network decoder, such as that in wireshark, that can inspect SMB traffic to identify the use of pipes. It could also be detected by looking for raw packet capture streams or from a custom sensor on the host that hooks the appropriate API functions. If no network or API level of visibility is possible, this traffic may inferred by looking at SMB connections over 445/tcp followed by the creation of files matching the pattern <code>C:\\Windows\\System32\\AT\\<job_id\\></code>.\n \n To detect AT via network traffic, a sensor is needed that has the ability to extract and decode PCAP information. Specifically, it needs to properly decode SMB and the functions that are implemented over it via NamedPipes. If a sensor meets these criteria, then the PCAP data needs to search for instances of the command <code>JobAdd</code> over the pipe <code>ATSVC</code>, which is all implemented over Windows SMB 445/tcp.\n \n Analytic 1 - Remotely Scheduled Tasks via AT\n \n <code>source=\"*Zeek:*\" (dest_port=445 AND proto_info.pipe=\"ATSVC\") AND (proto_info.function=\"JobAdd\")</code>",

PowerShell is a scripting environment included with Windows that is used by both attackers and administrators.

This analytic detects execution of PowerShell scripts.\n \n Powershell can be used to hide monitored command line execution such as:\n \n net use\n sc start\n \n Note: \n - The logic for Analytic 1 is based around detecting on non-interactive Powershell sessions (i.e., those not launched by a user through explorer.exe). This may lead to false positives when used in a production environment, so we recommend tuning any such analytics by including additional logic (e.g., looking for suspicious parent processes) that helps filter such events.\n - The logic for Analytic 2 is based around detecting on remote Powershell sessions.

Windows API calls such as <code>CreateRemoteThread</code> and those that can be used to modify memory within another process, such as <code>VirtualAllocEx</code>/<code>WriteProcessMemory</code>, may be used for this technique.(Citation: Elastic Process Injection July 2017)\n \n Search for remote thread creations that start at LoadLibraryA or LoadLibraryW. Depending on the tool, it may provide additional information about the DLL string that is an argument to the function. If there is any security software that legitimately injects DLLs, it must be carefully whitelisted.\n \n Microsoft Windows allows for processes to remotely create threads within other processes of the same privilege level. This functionality is provided via the Windows API CreateRemoteThread. Both Windows and third-party software use this ability for legitimate purposes. For example, the Windows process csrss.exe creates threads in programs to send signals to registered callback routines. Both adversaries and host-based security software use this functionality to inject DLLs, but for very different purposes. An adversary is likely to inject into a program to evade defenses or bypass User Account Control, but a security program might do this to gain increased monitoring of API calls. One of the most common methods of DLL Injection is through the Windows API LoadLibrary.\n \n - Allocate memory in the target program with VirtualAllocEx\n - Write the name of the DLL to inject into this program with WriteProcessMemory\n - Create a new thread and set its entry point to LoadLibrary using the API CreateRemoteThread.\n \n This behavior can be detected by looking for thread creations across processes, and resolving the entry point to determine the function name. If the function is LoadLibraryA or LoadLibraryW, then the intent of the remote thread is clearly to inject a DLL. When this is the case, the source process must be examined so that it can be ignored when it is both expected and a trusted process.",

    "mitreControlDescription": "Monitor for unexpected deletion of Windows event logs (via native binaries) and may also generate an alterable event (Event ID 1102: \"The audit log was cleared\"). When an eventlog is cleared, a new event is created that alerts that the eventlog was cleared. For Security logs, its event code 1100 and 1102. For System logs, it is event code 104.\n \n It is unlikely that event log data would be cleared during normal operations, and it is likely that malicious attackers may try to cover their tracks by clearing an event log. When an event log gets cleared, it is suspicious. \n \n 1. This is often done using wevtutil, a legitimate tool provided by Microsoft. This action interferes with event collection and notification, and may lead to a security event going undetected, thereby potentially leading to further compromise of the network. \n \n 2. Alerting when a Clear Event Log is generated could point to this intruder technique. Centrally collecting events has the added benefit of making it much harder for attackers to cover their tracks. Event Forwarding permits sources to forward multiple copies of a collected event to multiple collectors, thus enabling redundant event collection. Using a redundant event collection model can minimize the single point of failure risk. \n \n 3. Attackers may set the option of the sources of events with <code>Limit-EventLog -LogName Security -OverflowAction DoNotOverwrite</code> to not delete old Evenlog when the .evtx is full. By default the Security Log size is configured with the minimum value of 20 480KB (~23 000 EventLog). So if this option is enabled, all the new EventLogs will be automatically deleted. We can detect this behavior with the Security EventLog 1104. \n \n 4. Attackers may delete .evtx with <code>del C:\\Windows\\System32\\winevt\\logs\\Security.evtx</code> or <code>Remove-Item C:\\Windows\\System32\\winevt\\logs\\Security.evtx</code> after having disabled and stopped the Eventlog service. As the EventLog service is disabled and stopped, the .evtx files are no longer used by this service and can be deleted. The new EventLog will be Unavailable until the configuration is reset. \n \n 5. Attackers may use the powershell command <code>Remove-EventLog -LogName Security</code> to unregister source of events that are part of Windows (Application, Security…). This command deletes the security EventLog (which also generates EventId 1102) but the new Eventlogs are still recorded until the system is rebooted . After the System is rebooted, the Security log is unregistered and doesn’t log any new Eventlog. However logs generated between the command and the reboot are still available in the .evtx file.\n \n Analytic 1 - User Activity from Clearing Event Logs\n \n <code> (source=\"*WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode IN (1100, 1102, 1104)) OR (source=\"*WinEventLog:System\" EventCode IN (104))</code>",

Before [Exfiltration](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0010) that an adversary has [Collection](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0009), it is very likely that a [Archive Collected Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560) will be created, so that transfer times are minimized and fewer files are transmitted. There is variety between the tools used to compress data, but the command line usage and context of archiving tools, such as ZIP, RAR, and 7ZIP, should be monitored.\n In addition to looking for RAR or 7z program names, command line usage of 7Zip or RAR can be detected with the flag usage of “\\* a \\*”. This is helpful, as adversaries may change program names.\n \n Note: This analytic looks for the command line argument a, which is used by RAR. However, there may be other programs that have this as a legitimate argument and may need to be filtered out.\n \n Analytic 1 - Command Line Usage of Archiving Software\n \n <code> (source=\"WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"1\") OR (source=\"WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode=\"4688\") CommandLine=\"* a *\"</code>",
