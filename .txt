Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made, the IP address from which the request was made, which user made the request, when it was made, and additional details.(Citation: AWS Cloud Trail Backup API)\n In Azure, the creation of a snapshot may be captured in Azure activity logs. Backup restoration events can also be detected through Azure Monitor Log Data by creating a custom alert for completed restore jobs.(Citation: Azure - Monitor Logs)\n Google's Admin Activity audit logs within their Cloud Audit logs can be used to detect the usage of the gcloud compute instances create command to create a new VM disk from a snapshot.(Citation: Cloud Audit Logs) It is also possible to detect the usage of the GCP API with the \u003Ccode\u003EsourceSnapshot\u003C/code\u003E parameter pointed to \u003Ccode\u003Eglobal/snapshots/[BOOT_SNAPSHOT_NAME]\u003C/code\u003E.(Citation: GCP - Creating and Starting a VM)",
